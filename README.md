# Target_train.csv & Target_test.csv (Use target_train to develop your feature & target_test to evaluate your feature)
- Fraud_Flg_Target is the Real y to use when evaluating your FEATURE
- The other columns can be used to train your ML models 
- If you see a column named A__OR__B, it means it is generated by an OR operator between feature A and B


# Target_Merging.py
- You should always use this file to merge your Feature Set into the Target Set


# Feature_Binned_Visual.py(See Binned_Visual.ipynb for examples)
- Suppose you have merged your Feature Set into the Target Set
- You can VISUALIZE the Fraud Rate in your feature. Call the Numeric Version if your feature is Numeric; Call the Categorical Version if your feature is categorical
- For numeric feature, the function returns 2 Plots: Plot 1 is the fraud rate comparison between Non NAN Values and NAN Values in the feature; Plot 2 is a Quantiled Plot of fraud rate of Non NAN Values in the feature.
- For categorical feature, the function returns 1 Plot: fraud rate comparison among all categories(including the NAN category)


# Evaluation.py
- Make sure you feature is BINARY
- Return the metrics in the confusion matrix: acc, precision, recall, and F1

# downsample.py
- downsample the dataset and randomly remove ___% of the entries where the flg is True
- downsample your training dataset only! DO NOT DOWNSAMPLE your test dataset!!!!!!!!!!!
