Target.csv
- Fraud_Flg_Target is the Real y to use when evaluating your FEATURE
- The other columns can be used to train your ML models 
- If you see a column named A__OR__B, it means it is generated by an OR operator between feature A and B


Target_Merging.py
- You should always use this file to merge your Feature Set into the Target Set

To_Probabilities.py
- convert your feature values into probabilities(using softmax)
- enable confusion matrix to evaluate the feature

Evaluation.py
- Make sure you feature is converted into probabilities using To_Probabilities.py
- Return the metrics in the confusion matrix: acc, precision, recall, and F1
