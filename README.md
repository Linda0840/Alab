Target.csv
- Fraud_Flg_Target is the Real y to use when evaluating your FEATURE
- The other columns can be used to train your ML models 
- If you see a column named A__OR__B, it means it is generated by an OR operator between feature A and B


Target_Merging.py
- You should always use this file to merge your Feature Set into the Target Set

Feature_Binned_Visual.py(See Binned_Visual.ipynb for examples)
- Suppose you have merged your Feature Set into the Target Set
- You can VISUALIZE the Fraud Rate in your feature. Call the Numeric Version if your feature is Numeric; Call the Categorical Version if your feature is categorical
- For numeric feature, the function returns 2 Plots: Plot 1 is the fraud rate comparison between Non NAN Values and NAN Values in the feature; Plot 2 is a Quantiled Plot of fraud rate of Non NAN Values in the feature.
- For categorical feature, the function returns 1 Plot: fraud rate comparison among all categories(including the nan category) --> make it easier to understand!


To_Probabilities.py
- convert your feature values into probabilities(using softmax)
- enable confusion matrix to evaluate the feature


Evaluation.py
- Make sure you feature is converted into probabilities using To_Probabilities.py
- Return the metrics in the confusion matrix: acc, precision, recall, and F1
